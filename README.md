# Facial Emotion Recognition System

## Overview
The **Facial Emotion Recognition System** is a project designed to accurately predict human emotions from facial images. Utilizing deep neural network algorithms, the system classifies facial emotions into categories: **Anger**, **Fear**, **Happiness**, **Neutral**, **Sadness**, and **Surprise**.

## Features ✨
- **Emotion Classification**: Identifies and classifies emotions based on facial expressions.
- **Deep Learning Algorithms**: Trained using advanced neural networks for high accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays results and analysis of the prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow/Keras 📊
- OpenCV 🖼️
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈

## Usage 🚀

 - Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/JohnNase/Facial-Emption-Reconition-System.git
 - Navigate to the project directory: cd Facial-Emption-Reconition-System
 - Run the main script: python main.py

## Dataset 📚

 The model is trained using a dataset that includes labeled facial images for various emotions. Ensure that the dataset is properly organized in the specified directory structure before training the model.
